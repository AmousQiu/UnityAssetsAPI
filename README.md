## How to set it up on your server?  
- #### You would need to set up these stuff on your server
      - Apache
      - php
      - phpMyadmin
      - mysql    
<br>
   
- #### Now download the file folder
 
- #### Upload the whole folder to your target server 
 
  
  - Linux   
  `scp  â€“r  Desktop/UnityAPI/ zqiu@bluenose.cs.dal.ca:~/public_html`  
    Local Repository:  `Desktop/UnityAPI/`   
    `//change this to your folder`   
    Server Repository:  `zqiu@bluenose.cs.dal.ca:~/public_html`   
    `//change this to your own`
  - Windows  
      > I'm not suggesting using windows bro.      
        But if you insist, just copy and paste this folder to your target place

## How should I use it for other kind of files? 

- ### InsertData.php
--- 
  ```php
  //change this to your servername for phpMyadmin  
   $servername = null;  
  ```
  ```php
  //change this to your username for phpMyAdmin  
  $username = "root";
  ```
  
  ```php
  //change this to your password for phpMyAdmin  
  $password = null;
  ```

  ```php
  //change this to your database name   
  $dbName = "Server";
  ``` 

  ```php
  //change 'Table' and 'Name' according to your database  
  $sql = "select * from Table where Name='" . $FileName . "'";
  ```

```php
  //change 'Table' and 'Name' according to your database  
  $sql = "INSERT INTO Table (Name) VALUES ('" . $FileName . "')";  
```
